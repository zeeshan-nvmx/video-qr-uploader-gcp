# video-qr-uploader-google-cloud-version

## This is another version of the video upload/download single file api of my video-qr-uploader project. In this one I used Google Cloud Platform instead of using local vps or hosting storage for the upload location. 


### 1. create a gcp project.
### 2. create a service account and download the service key.
### 3. extract the credentials and put them into the .env file. (create the .env file at the root directory )
### 4. create a bucket in google cloud storage.
### 5. replace the bucket name in code.
